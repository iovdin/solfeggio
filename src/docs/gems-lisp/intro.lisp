(h1 "Diving Deep with Jisp")
(p "Hey there! Over the past few years, I've been rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty with Jisp. If you haven't heard of it, well, you're in for a treat. Created by the one and only Nelo Mitranim, Jisp is like the cool hybrid child of Lisp and JavaScript. Think of it as combining your favorite pizza toppings; you get the best of both worlds!")
(p "So, why is Jisp awesome? It's a Lisp-to-JS compiler that's all about embracing JavaScript. It's like speaking a foreign language but with your hometown accent. This means you can easily pull in and play with anything originally written in JavaScript.")
(p "This space is all about the cool tricks and \"gems\" I've found (or made up) using Jisp. Plus, there might be a few chuckles along the way. Because, hey, coding should be fun, right?")
